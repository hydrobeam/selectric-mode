Make your Emacs sound like a proper typewriter. Extremely useful if you
have a puny, silent, rubberish, non-clicky keyboard.

"I noticed this in the Spacemacs config and have it set up for occasional use.
Makes writing documentation feel more important." -- mcguire on Hacker News

The sound of the typewriter moving and typing was recorded by a person
nicknamed "secretmojo" and is available on
https://www.freesound.org/people/secretmojo/sounds/224012/ and the bell
was extracted from https://freesound.org/people/knufds/sounds/345955/,
recorded by "knufds", both available under a Creative Commons
license. The sound of the margin bell, was extracted from
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOIPN70f_-I by Joe Heyming.

To install it, simply add it to your load-path, require it:

```elisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/plugins/selectric-mode")
(require 'selectric-mode)
```

And then activate/deactivate with M-x `selectric-mode`. When it's
activated, you'll hear a typing sound for confirmation. When it
deactivates, you'll hear a carriage movement sound instead.

Alternatively, you can install it from [MELPA](https://melpa.org).To
install it, type <kbd>M-x package-install [ret] selectric-mode</kbd>
